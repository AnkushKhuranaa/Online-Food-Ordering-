PROBLEM STATEMENT

Problems with existing system: 

Unnecessary delays by visiting restaurants to place and pay for orders. 

Orders placed over the phone lack visual confirmation of order being placed correctly. 

Large man-power is needed by restaurants to ensure a rich dining experience and interacting with customers online/on-site. 


PROPOSED SOFTWARE

With high labor rates, it is difficult to find employees when needed. An "Online Food Order System" is proposed which would address such an issue. The system automates the ordering process and simplifies transaction process made by the customer. Anticipated benefits are: 

Minimial number of employees at the back of the counter. 
Reduced labor costs. 
Automated processes are less prone to errors. 
Faster service at restaurants by increasing the speed of execution and number of optimum screens to accommodate the maximum throughput.

Online ordering system presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with all available options in an easy to use manner. Once the order is placed, confirmation details are sent to the customer and are entered in the database and retrieved in real time. This allows employees to quickly go through the orders as they are received and process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.
