# Online-Food-Ordering-

PROBLEM STATEMENT

In existing system there are few problems: 

For placing any orders customers have to visit hotels or restaurants to know about food items and then place order and pay. In this method time and manual work is required. 
While placing an order over the phone, customer lacks the physical copy of the menu item, lack of visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly. 
Every restaurant needs certain employees to take the order over phone or in-person, to offer a rich dining experience and process the payment. 


PROPOSED SOFTWARE

In today’s market, labor rates are increasing day by day making it difficult to find employees when needed. Hence, to solve this issue, what I propose is an “Online Food Order System”. The main advantage of my system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for the customer and also greatly lightens the load on the restaurant’s end, as the entire process of taking orders is automated. Anticipated Benefits are: 

This will minimize the number of employees at the back of the counter. 
The system will help to reduce labor cost involved. 
The system will be less probable to make mistake, since it’s a machine. 
This will avoid long queues at the counter due to the speed of execution and number of optimum screens to accommodate the maximum throughput.

Online ordering system that I am proposing here, greatly simplifies the ordering process for the customer. System presents an interactive and up-to-date menu with all available options in an easy to use manner. Customer gets order confirmation details. Once the order is placed it is entered in the database and retrieved in pretty much real time. This allows employees to quickly go through the orders as they are received and process all orders efficiently and effectively with minimal delays and confusion.
